in this project i tried to classify 3 types of galaxies(spiral, Elliptical, uncertain) according to their features from tabular data i got from Galaxy zoo project(here is the link address to download the dataset
http://galaxy-zoo-1.s3.amazonaws.com/GalaxyZoo1_DR_table2.csv.zip)
although i got an accuracy 90% on both train and validation set but i'm still trying to improve that with trying different methods.
