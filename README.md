in this project, I tried to classify 3 types of galaxies(spiral, Elliptical, uncertain) according to their features from tabular data I got from the Galaxy zoo project(here is the link address to download the dataset http://galaxy-zoo-1.s3.amazonaws.com/GalaxyZoo1_DR_table2.csv.zip)
although I got an accuracy of 90% on both train and validation set but I'm still trying to improve that with trying different methods.
